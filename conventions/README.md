# 0xcert Conventions

*Conventions* are data models that allow your application to interoperate with other applications using the 0xcert Protocol. Additionally, conventions enable *imprints*, a tamper-evident system for assuring data consistency in which some of the data can be public and some can be private.

## What's in this directory?

This directory contains *approved* conventions and represents best practices in industry. These conventions are public. You can use these public conventions as-is, derive your own more specific versions of these public conventions or create your own conventions from scratch.

## Convention format

Please see the [base asset schema](./86-base-asset-schema.md) as an example of the convention format. Also, every convention must adopt this base asset schema.
