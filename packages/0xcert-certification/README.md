```ts
// VERIFICATION
// I share an evidence file that proofs certain JSON paths (e.g. public JSON)
// I have an object with just some data.
// The function recreates a recipe for this partial data object and assignes is to the evidence file.
// At this stage we modified evidence file with data we know.
// We then calculate the imprint which must match the one stored in the token.
// NOTE: Custom fields always pass.

// WORDING
// evidence -> consists of proofs -> forms an imprint
// data object -> consists of properties (props)
```
