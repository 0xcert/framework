> Asset certification module for 0xcert Framework.

```ts
// Define arbitrary data object.
const data = { ... };

// Define certificate with JSON schema definition.
const cert = new Cert({ schema: { ...} });

// Notarize data object (returns all imprints for whole data object).
const imprints = await cert.notarize(data);

// Expose selected data keys (returns imprints and exposed values from which an imprint can be calculated).
const imprints = await cert.disclose(exampleData, [ ...paths... ]);

// Verify data object against imprints generated with function `disclose` (if object is valid, an imprint is the right root hash).
const imprint = await cert.calculate(data, imprints);

// Generate root hash from complete data object.
const imprint = await cert.imprint(data);
```

The [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org) is a free and open-source JavaScript library that provides tools for building powerful decentralized applications. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.0xcert.org) for more details.

This module is one of the bricks of the [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org). It's written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and it's actively maintained.
