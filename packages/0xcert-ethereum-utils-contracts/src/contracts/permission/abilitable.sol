/**
 * @title Contract for setting abilities.
 * @dev For optimization purposes the abilities are represented as a bitfield. Maximum number of
 * abilities is therefore 256. This is an example(for simplicity is made for max 8 abilities) of how
 * this works. 
 * 00000001 Ability 1 - number representation 1
 * 00000010 Ability 2 - number representation 2
 * 00000100 Ability 3 - number representation 4
 * 00001000 Ability 4 - number representation 8
 * 00010000 Ability 5 - number representation 16
 * etc ... 
 * To assign abilities 2 and 3 we would need a bitfield of 00000110 which is represented by number 6
 * in other words the sum od ability 2 and 3. The same concept works for revoking abilities and 
 * checking if someone has multiple abilities.
 * By default abilities are set to 00000000 which means there are no abilities.
