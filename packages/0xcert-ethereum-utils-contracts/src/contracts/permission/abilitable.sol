/**
 * @title Contract for setting abilities.
 * @dev For optimization purposes the abilities are represented as a bitfield. Maximum number of
 * abilities is therefore 256. This is an example(for simplicity is made for max 8 abilities) of how
 * this works. 
 * 00000001 Ability A - number representation 1
 * 00000010 Ability B - number representation 2
 * 00000100 Ability C - number representation 4
 * 00001000 Ability D - number representation 8
 * 00010000 Ability E - number representation 16
 * etc ... 
 * To grant abilities B and C, we would need a bitfield of 00000110 which is represented by number
 * 6, in other words, the sum of abilities B and C. The same concept works for revoking abilities
 * and checking if someone has multiple abilities.
