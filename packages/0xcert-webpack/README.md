# ðŸ§± Webpack Module

*Package building and minification*

## Purpose

The 0xcert Framework is written in TypeScript. And while developing, testing and improving 0xcert Framework, this is the best language to use.

But for end users to run the framework in a web browser securely, they will need JavaScript files. This module generates those JavaScript files.

## Walkthrough

To regenerate the files in the `dist` folder, just run:

```sh
rushx build
```

The `dist` folder must be updated with ever commit in the 0xcert Framework repository. And it is checked automatically with our continuous integration tools.

## The big picture

The [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org) is a free and open-source JavaScript library that provides tools for building powerful decentralized applications. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.0xcert.org) for more details.

This module is one of the bricks of the [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org). Itâ€™s written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and itâ€™s actively maintained. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xcert/framework) where you can also find our [issue tracker](https://github.com/0xcert/framework/issues).
