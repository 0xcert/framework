# ðŸ§± Conventions Module

*The TypeScript implementation of all confirmed 0xcert conventions*

## Purpose

This module provides TypeScript interfaces for all the confirmed application data conventions.

Yes, the 0xcert Conventions are just simply JSON objects. And you could create them yourself. But we have created this simple module to bring you type-safe TypeScript goodness.

## Next steps

* Learn more about conventions at https://conventions.0xcert.org.

## The big picture

The [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org) is a free and open-source JavaScript library that provides tools for building powerful decentralized applications. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.0xcert.org) for more details.

This module is one of the bricks of the [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org). Itâ€™s written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and itâ€™s actively maintained. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xcert/framework) where you can also find our [issue tracker](https://github.com/0xcert/framework/issues).
