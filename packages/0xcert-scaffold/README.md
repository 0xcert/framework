> Overarching module with types, enums, and interfaces for easier development of interoperable modules.

The [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org) is a free and open-source JavaScript library that provides tools for building powerful decentralized applications. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.0xcert.org) for more details.

This module is one of the bricks of the [0xcert Framework](https://docs.0xcert.org). It's written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and it's actively maintained. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/0xcert/framework) where you can also find our [issue tracker](https://github.com/0xcert/framework/issues).

# Scaffold Interfaces

These TypeScript interfaces are platform-agnostic base types which are implemented separately in for each provider.

Or in plain English, these are the base data structures in the 0xcert protocol regardless of whether you are using it on a blockchain or MongoDB.
