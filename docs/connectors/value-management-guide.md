# Value Management

If we take the example from [Asset Management guide]() we said that banknotes and coins are not asset since they are fungible (interchangeable while retaining the same value). Value is what we use to describe exactly this kinds of items. Value management is all about currencies, tokens, etc. 

Fungible tokens are represented on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) standard. This standard defines how the basic smart contract looks like and how each fungible tokens are defined. The 0xcert framework allows you to simply create and manage your own token.

In simmilar way as `AssetLedger` represents non fungible tokens the `ValueLedger` represents fundgible tokens. Meaning things we do with an `ValueLedger` are directly reflected on the ERC-20 smart contract on the blockchain.

TLDR: An value ledgerÂ is a containter defining how value is defined on the blockchain. Value is defined as a digital representation of fungible tokens (currency).

## Installation

We recommend you employ the package as an NPM package in your application.

```ell
$ npm i --save @0xcert/ethereum-value-ledger
```

On our official [GitHub repository](https://github.com/0xcert/framework), we also host a compiled and minimized JavaScript file that can be directly implemented in your website. Please refer to the [API](/api/core.html) section to learn more about value ledger.

## Creating a new ValueLedger

We begin by importing the modules.

```ts
import { ValueLedger } from '@0xcert/ethereum-value-ledger';
```

Now lets define what kind of `ValueLedger` we want to deploy.

```ts
const valueLedgerDefinition = {
  name: 'Utility token',
  symbol: 'UTT',
  decimals: '18',
  supply: '500000000000000000000000000', // 500 mio
};
```

Here we name and set an symbol(ticker) to our value ledger. Then we set how many decimals we want when dealing with the tokens and finally its supply. When defining supply we need to be careful to incorprate the amount of decimals we defined.

::: tip
The author creating a new `ValueLedger` automatically becomes the owner of its whole supply.
:::

Now we can actually deploy the value ledger.

```ts
const mutation = await ValueLedger.deploy(provider, valueLedgerDefinition).then((mutation) => {
  return mutation.complete();
});

const valueLedgerId = mutation.receiverId;;
```

Now that we have created a new value ledger on the network, we can load its instance.

```ts
const valueLedger = ValueLedger.getInstance(provider, valueLedgerId);
```

First, let's read the value ledger data to see if everything is as we configured.

```ts
const valueLedgerInfo = await valueLedger.getInfo();
//=> { name: 'Utility token', symbol: 'UTT', decimals: '18', supply: '500000000000000000000000000' }
```

## Transfer value

Since we are the owner of all the created value we can now transfer some to someone else.

```ts
const mutation = await valueLedger.transferValue({
    receiverId: '0x...',
    value: '100000000000000000000', // 100
}).then((mutation) => {
    return mutation.complete();
});
```

All we need to do is specify the `receiverId` with a valid ethereum wallet address and enter amount of `value` we want to send. We have to consider the amount of decimals when defining the amount.

We can now verify if the value was succesfully transfered by checking the receivers balance.

```ts
const balance = await valueLedger.getBalance('0x...');
//=> 100000000000000000000
```
