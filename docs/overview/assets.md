Recently, another kind of token called non-fungible tokens started getting attention in the crypto community. Though we knew non-fungible tokens before, it actually all started with Crypto Kitties - tradable collectibles, which set the foundation for the now accepted ERC-721 standard. Unlike the ERC-20 identical tokens, the non-fungible tokens are unique and carry data.

The 0xcert protocol goes even further and introduces an Xcert as a standardized and certified non-fungible token based on ERC-721 and 0xcert conventions that carries information about a particular unique asset. This mechanism is unique to the 0xcert protocol and is described in later sections.

ERC-721 has given us an incredibly powerful standard on the Ethereum network - non-fungible tokens. The 0xcert protocol extends this standard and makes it opinionated. This will drastically shorten development times. For example, think about what Rails did for Ruby. 0xcert is dealing with the application layer where developers need to act fast and agile. In order to ensure interoperability among applications in the future, Xcerts follow specific conventions. This will prevent incompatibility on a higher level, which might happen if every NFT issuer deploys their own version of an industry standard. Having this level of standardization built on top of a strong ERC-721 standard prevents high level fragmentation and safeguards long-term sustainability.
