# Getting Started

The 0xcert Framework is a JavaScript library for building the application logic for fungible and non-fungible assets. For more details about the Framework, please refer to the chapter XXX.

This guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript and at least basic understanding of difference between currencies and assets. Basid comprehension of blockchain technology and framework systems is welcome but not compulsory.

In order to expose the Framework in all its beauty, the code snippets in this document are written in TypeScript. This way, the developers using the Framework will find it more familiar and easier to work with.

Requirements
Node.js > v8.x
NPM > v6.x

Before you start with any serious taska, you should understand the meaning and function of query, mutation, private key, etc.
