# Getting Started

This guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript and at least basic understanding of difference between currencies and assets. Basid comprehension of blockchain technology and framework systems is welcome but not compulsory.

## Requirements

* Node.js > v8.x
* NPM > v6.x
* Browser with ES6 support

Before you start with any serious task, you should understand the meaning and function of query, mutation, private key, etc.

In order to expose the Framework in all its beauty, the code snippets in this document are written in TypeScript. This way, the developers using the Framework will find it more familiar and easier to work with.


::: tip
The examples in this guide are written for the Ethereum blockchain. This is not an obstacle when applying the guide to be used with any other system, since the 0xcert Framework is platform-agnostic and uses the same interface for all the underlying systems.
