# Introduction

The 0xcert Framework is a JavaScript library that provides tools for building powerful decentralized applications (dapps).

## What is 0xcert Framework?

The 0xcert Framework enables management of **assets** and **values**.

**Assets** are non-fungible tokens (NFTs), compliant with the Ethereum's ERC-721 standard. Assets can represent a unique, either digital or real-life item with its unique metadata stored as a data imprint on a distributed ledger.

Management of **values**, on the other hand, deals with cryptocurrency tokens compliant with the ERC-20 standard. Values represent fungible tokens that share the same value as any other of their kind which makes them optimal to serve as a monetary value token.

## What does it solve?

Due to the complexity of low-level blockchain solutions, the wide adoption of non-fungible tokes and blockchain, in general, is slower than it could be. The lack of conventions prevents interoperability among applications. Developers trying to develop their own decentralized application using non-fungible tokens face long development time and huge risk in their development process and security, lowering the overall efficiency and adoption rate. The resulting ecosystem of digital assets is under risk of being fragmented and developing non-interoperable dapps for underlying data.

## Who is it for?

Our mission is to equip application developers with a secure and agnostic framework for building modern decentralized applications (dapps). 0xcert is a pluggable settlement with an advanced integration layer for different dapps and relay applications. This enables developers to focus on the application layer and quickly build dapps for issuing university certificates, KYC applications, applications for loyalty programs, warranties, badges, credits or even a decentralized non-fungible exchange. 

## Features

The 0xcert Framework enables an effective and multi-function library for building decentralized applications. Its core features include:

* **Management of digital or real-world tangible items:** The Framework provide a set of functions for deployment, management, certification, and verification of assets. These can hold a data imprint of an item they represent, meaning they store a cryptographic representation of data objects. Such assets can be selectively verified by any third party to which the data is disclosed by the owner.

* **Management of digital currency:** Besides non-fungible, unique assets, the Framework also supports the management of monetary value tokens or cryptocurrencies. They are handled through common functions known in blockchain operations - transfer and management of rights.

* **Many-to-many atomic operations:** A single atomic transaction allows for creating and transferring tokens (both ERC-721 non-fungible and ERC-20 fungible tokens) as many times as agreed, and among multiple participants involved. Many-to-many atomic operations allow multiple parties to participate simultaneously in a single transaction. This is one of the most powerful and crucial features of the 0xcert Framework. 

* **Unified experience for decentralized and distributed systems:** The goal of the 0xcert Framework is to become blockchain/system-agnostic, without discriminating among different blockchains or other distributed systems. The whole API of the Framework is identical when used with the Ethereum blockchain or any other distributed system you choose for your application. The code of the API looks completely identical and provides the exact same functionality regardless of the blockchain or distributed system you employ. This enables you to easily and seamlessly switch between systems.

* **Data conventions:** We have set up the rules for interoperability between applications built on top of the 0xcert Framework. They are of crucial importance for adoption among businesses. Each asset data object is defined and managed by conventions that provide a unifying layer to the systems, which in turn enables different applications to communicate amongst themselves.
Suggestions for new conventions are always welcome and we invite anyone to support the development of the ecosystem. Simply open a new issue on GitHub and invite the interested audience to provide feedback and finally approve the new convention.

## Our vision

The vision of 0xcert is to provide an open framework with the protocol for standardized and certified unique assets to a broader tech audience. With the 0xcert Framework, you can build your decentralized applications on top of distributed and decentralized systems, employing a complete toolset, development framework, and a set of conventions for various use cases. This results in shorter development time, lower risk and cost associated with developing decentralized solutions like blockchain-based apps. The 0xcert Framework can support a wide range of decentralized applications and business models, giving companies the power to fully utilize the potential of the blockchain technology.
