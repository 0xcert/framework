# Communication

Communication with the blockchain and similar systems is quite different than communication with other storage systems. Two different kinds of communication are employed within the 0xcert Framework - `query` and `mutation`.

## What are queries?

The process of reading a state from the underlying system is called a **query**. A query represents an instant request which is fast and usually free of charge, and typically does not need any kind of account information. A query reads data from the system and primarily represents a `GET` operation.

```ts
import { AssetLedger } from '@0xcert/ethereum-asset-ledger';

// initialize a ledger
const ledgerId = '0xcc567f78e8821fb8d19f7e6240f44553ce3dbfce';
const ledger = new AssetLedger(provider, ledgerId);

// perform a query
const balance = await ledger.getBalance(accountId);
```

## What are mutations?

On the other hand, the 0xcert Framework performs **mutations** for any request that changes the state on the underlying system (e.g., smart contract on the blockchain). If a query represents a `GET` operation, then a mutation represents `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` operations. The 0xcert Framework adopts the concept of confirmations common in the blockchain systems, therefore, changing a state needs to be confirmed by the involved providers (miners).

Usually, mutations need to be paid to the involved parties who support the system. The fee depends on the storage and computation power required to process a mutation, and is based on the traffic congestion of the network.

Mutations must be performed from a userâ€™s account, and the user has to confirm every mutation concerning their assets or values.

```ts
import { MetamaskProvider } from '@0xcert/ethereum-metamask-provider';
import { AssetLedger } from '@0xcert/ethereum-asset-ledger';

// initialize a provider
const provider = new MetamaskProvider();

// initialize a ledger
const ledgerId = '0xcc567f78e8821fb8d19f7e6240f44553ce3dbfce';
const ledger = new AssetLedger(provider, ledgerId);

// enqueue mutation for processing
const mutation = await ledger.enableTransfers().then((mutation) => {
    // wait until confirmed
    return mutation.complete();
});
```

To perform a mutation, we first need to send a request to the system to be accepted for handling. Once such request is approved, the response is transmitted in the form of mutation details which include a unique ID of the mutation. We can use this ID to track the state of mutation and its confirmation. Mutation with at least one confirmation can be considered completed.

This is a general description of how mutations in the 0xcert Framework work. For specific details about how mutations work within the system of your choice, please refer to its official documentation.
