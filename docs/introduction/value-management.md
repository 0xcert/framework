## About

Value is a representation of currency/fundgible tokens(ERC20 on ethereum blockchain). So if you would like to operate with ZXC tokens you would encapsulate that as value. 

## What you can do with value

### Transfer

If you are the owner of 5000 ZXC token you can transfer this tokens to someone else. To be able to transfer value you need to know the recipient and the amount you would like to transfer to them. 

### Approve

Owner of tokens can approve someone else for a specific amount. That means he has the same control over that amount as you would have. He can transfer those tokens freely so use this with caution. Owner can approve/revoke approval at anytime.
