# Getting started

The documentationguides walks you through the main features of the 0xcert Framework. It gives you an overview of the concepts and mechanics, as well as the directions on how to write your code. The API references, on the other hand, provides detailed information and describes the interfaces.

## How to proceed?

To expose the 0xcert Framework in all its beauty, the code snippets in the documentation are written in TypeScript. This way, developers using the framework will find it more familiar and more comfortable to work with.

Most examples are written for the 0xcertAPI and the Ethereum blockchain connectors. This, however, is not an obstacle when applying this guide to Wanchain or any other system since the 0xcert Framework is platform-agnostic and uses the same interface for all the underlying systems.

## Requirements

First, make sure you use the latest software.

* Node.js > v10.x
* NPM > v6.x
* Browser with ES6 support

This guide assumes an intermediate level knowledge of TypeScript and at least a basic understanding of the difference between currencies and assets. Basic comprehension of distributed ledger technology and frameworks is welcome but not required.
