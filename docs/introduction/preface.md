## Vocabulary

In the course of the documentation there will be a lot of terminology that may not be clear from the get go. This is because we are trying to bridge the gap between blockchain terminology and terminology that is more common to web developers. Alongside that we are also blockchain agnostic which adds another level of how to correctly define something. To combat all this we tought long and hard to come up with a more generic teminology that everyone could understand. This is a quick list of our results:

| Termin       | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Asset        | Is a representation of a unique item. Also knows as non fundgible token or ERC721(standard on ethereum blockchain.) |
| Value        | Is a representation of currency. Also known as token (ERC20 on ethereum blockchain). |
| Query        | Is an action with which we read data from the blockchain.    |
| Mutation     | Is an action with which we write/change data on the blockchain. |
| Atomic order | It enables that different actions(such as transfer of asset and value) are performed in a compleatly decentralized matter. |
| Asset ledger | Storage for assets.                                          |
| Value ledger | Storage for value.                                           |
|              |                                                              |
|              |                                                              |
